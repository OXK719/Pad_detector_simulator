# Pad_detector_simulator
A program to simulate a pad detector and plot fields and drift paths of electrons and holes.

 The program uses the KDetSim library in root, Cern's open-source data analysis framework. KDetSim may be installed from here: http://kdetsim.org/ and root from here: https://root.cern/install/
 
 ELectrons and holes are generated within the diode and their drift paths plotted.
 
 The electric field and electric potential across the didoe are plotted in 2D, as well as the weighting field and weighting potential.
